# Floating-Stack-Point
Using x86 Assembly and C, I created a floating stack point machine which the decimal number ”21602” is converted to it’s hexadecimal form ”5462”

The purpose of this program is to understand the division method for converting decimal numbers (base 10) to hexadecimal numbers
(base 16). This method is implemented in C. The program in C is then used as a guideline to write the same program in assembly
language. In this program, the decimal number ”21602” is converted to it’s hexadecimal form ”5462”.

Done for CS118 in my sophomore year of college.
